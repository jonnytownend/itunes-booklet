# iTunes Album Art Book Maker

The beginnings of a Python app to create an album art PDF booklet from a users iTunes Library. The idea is to create a novel way of cataloguing a users iTunes Library in a sleek printable booklet of album art in 'Date Added' order, with significant albums given a full-page or half-page spread.

This project is inspired by my fear of loosing my digital music collection in the distant future, and the fact that I own very little physical music anymore. My hope is that such a book will be found - dusty and discoloured - in a loft somewhere in 30 years time, and I'll be able to look back over my music library long after my hard drives have been lost / damaged / burnt / destroyed in WW3.

Goal of the app:
* Link app to iTunes Library folder
* User will specify significant albums 
* PDF booklet will be generated including:
	* Album art in 'Date Added' order, with {Month} - {Year} headings
	* Significant albums highlighted in a full-page or half-page spread
	* Optional index generated at back of book for quick lookups

Feel free to contribute to this project!
